# ChipSharp
A CHIP-8 emulator in C#

The hardware of the CHIP-8 is rather minimal. As such all code easily fitted within [Program.cs](https://github.com/Saticmotion/ChipSharp/blob/main/Program.cs)

The program can be run by opening ChipSharp.sln in Visual Studio, and then running the project.

By default an opcode test suite will be run.
